# Copy this file and change the following settings:

# whitelist:  which objects will you index?
# if this is missing, 0 records will be fetched from the Dor Fetcher service
# the whitelist can be
#   1. an array of druids inline here, e.g. ['druid:oo123oo1234', 'druid:oo234oo2345']
#   2. a filename containing a list of druids (one per line)
# if a druid is for a collection record (per the object's identityMetadata at purl page)
#  then we process all the item druids in that collection (as if they were included individually in the whitelist)
# if a druid is for an item object, then we process that druid
#whitelist: ['druid:dq441rn2614']
#  either give absolute path or path relative to where the command will be executed
#whitelist: config/ap_whitelist.txt
whitelist: ['druid:ms016pb9280']
